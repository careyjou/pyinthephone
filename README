wsgi_demo.py: Does lots of things:
    fill_template() and textarea demo was originally in wsgi_textarea.py.
    Adds a "@route()" decorator that does wildcards.
    Serves the following routes:
    /
    /index.html
    /faviocon.ico
      	Actually serves	SL4A.jpg as image/jpeg.  (Is that right?)
    /welcome.html
        Says hello with script path (like wsgi_hello.py) using fill_template().
    /textarea
        Textarea demo now adds an input/response pair when you click "run".
    /environ
      	Prints out the environ dictionary.  This is a little insecure
        since it includes some of your Unix environment variables.
    /static/
    /download/
      	Shows a listing of files that you "allowed" on the command line when
      	you started the wsgi_demo.py server.
        Each is shown with "view" and "download" links.
      	Also gives a link to (see below	for why)
      	   http://www.digiblog.de/2011/04/android-and-the-download-file-headers
    /static/*
        Treat the * part of the path as ./[path/]filename relative to
        where wsgi_demo.py is running.  Serve only allowed files.
        Serve the file as "text/plain".  This is where the "view" links go.
    /download/*
      	Same set of files each served as
      	    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
      	    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="thefilename.ext"
      	Still trying to hack this to get my DEFY XT to download files.
      	It may be that the BaseHTTPServer needs to do
            self.protocol_version = 'HTTP/1.1'
   	instead of the current default 1.0.  As suggested in comment at:
            https://gist.github.com/josiahcarlson/3250376
      	Or (just now thinking) maybe application/binary?
